    <p>The Drug regimen of Capomulin was effective in reducing the tumor volume in a mouse over a 45 day period by 35%. Continuing the study past 45 days could tell us the efficacy of Capomulin.</p>
    <p>Both regimens had the lowest mean, and lowest Standard deviations. With a starting tumor volume of 45, only Capomulin and Ramicane reduced tumor volume after 45 days. Based on final tumor volume both Capomulin and Ramicane appeared to be equally effective.</p>
    
    <p>There is a positive correlation between average tumor volume and weight within the subject mice at 0.84. But what does that mean? Correlation does not imply causation.</p>
    
    <p>The study population was 51% / 49% male to female. Further analysis shows that Capomulin's population was 55.7% female and 44.3% male, while Ramicane's population was 67.5% male and 32.5% female. It would be worth further study to sex correlates to efficacy of these drug regimens.</p>
